# Cynetics CLI Simplification Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Created a Simplified Entry Point**:
   - Developed `cynetics_simple.py` - a new simplified CLI with a configuration wizard
   - Added an easy-to-use interface that guides users through initial setup
   - Implemented persistent configuration storage in `~/.cynetics_config.yaml`

2. **Enhanced Installation Options**:
   - Updated `setup.py` to include the simplified CLI as a console script
   - Created `package.json` for npm-based installation
   - Added executable scripts in the `bin/` directory

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Created a configuration wizard that helps users set up model providers (OpenAI, Ollama)
   - Added tool selection during setup
   - Made configuration persistent across sessions

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added clear instructions for simplified usage
   - Created `config_simple_example.yaml` for quick start
   - Updated README with npm installation instructions

## How to Use the Simplified CLI

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Run the simplified CLI - it will guide you through setup
cynetics-simple
```

### Alternative npm Installation
```bash
# Install using npm
npm install

# Start the CLI
npm start

# Or run setup wizard
npm run setup
```

### Commands
- `cynetics-simple` - Run the CLI with automatic setup
- `cynetics-simple --setup` - Run configuration wizard
- `cynetics-simple --repl` - Start in REPL mode
- `cynetics-simple --version` - Show version information

The simplified CLI automatically saves your configuration to `~/.cynetics_config.yaml` for future sessions, making it much easier to get started with Cynetics CLI.
